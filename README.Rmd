The goal of shilohkira is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of shilohkira like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
setwd("/Users/shilohliu/Dropbox/shilohkira")
sheet_names <- excel_sheets("data-raw/mousedata.xlsx")
all_sheets <- lapply(sheet_names, function(sheet) {
  read_excel("data-raw/mousedata.xlsx", sheet = sheet)
})
names(all_sheets) <- sheet_names
Birth <- all_sheets[[1]]    
Bodyweight <- all_sheets[[2]] 
Outcome <- all_sheets[[3]]  
```
```{r}
newBirth <- check_and_rename_levels(Birth, "Treatment")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
